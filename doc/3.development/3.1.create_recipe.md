Generate source code URI
========================

Firstly, create an empty file which will store source code information:
```sh
touch recipes-debian/sources/<source_name>.inc
```

Enable `debian-source` in `<your buildir>/conf/local.conf`:
```sh
DEBIAN_SOURCE_ENABLED = "1"
DEBIAN_SRC_FORCE_REGEN = "1"
```

When bitbake run, class `debian-source` will generate information
about version, source URI and checksum to `.inc` file.

*NOTE: By default, `debian-source` will not rerun if
file `Sources.gz` does not change. Force it regenerate by adding
`DEBIAN_SRC_FORCE_REGEN = "1"` into `conf/local.conf` in the build directory.*

Write recipe
============

Recipe in `meta-debian` is almost similar with recipe in `meta`,
but there are some rules need to be concerned.

### Recipe name

* Recipe name `PN` should be same with recipe name in layer `meta`
  and has version suffix `_debian`:

   ```
   meta-debian/recipes-debian/*/<PN>_debian.bb
   ```

### Required resources
* Always inherit `debian-package` and include
  `sources/<source_name>.inc` in recipe.

   ```sh
   inherit debian-package
   require recipes-debian/sources/<source_name>.inc
   ```

### Reuse codes from `meta`
* Recipe should include available `.inc` from `meta` if possible.
  File `.inc` should be included before `inherit debian-package`,
  so `SRC_URI` can be overridden.
   Ex:
   ```sh
   require recipes-devtools/binutils/binutils.inc
   ...
   inherit debian-package
   ```

* Recipe also can reuse patches/local-files from `meta` if append `FILESPATH`.
   Ex:
   ```sh
   FILESPATH_append = ":${COREBASE}/meta/recipes-devtools/sample/sample"
   SRC_URI += "file://sample.patch"
   ```
   *Note: Security fixes should be managed by Debian in source package,
   so don't reuse patches, which relate to CVE or security bugs, in meta-debian.
   It is better to wait for Debian maintainers apply patch into source code.*

### Configuration and packages split
* This version of meta-debian aims to be compatible with
  Poky more than Debian, so recipe should configure and
  split packages same as Poky recipe to avoid conflict.
